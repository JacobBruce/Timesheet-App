# Timesheet App

A simple timesheet web app running on PHP and MYSQL. It was originally designed for a construction company but should be easy to customize if you know a little PHP.

## Installing

Use the `db.sql` file inside the `install` folder to create the MYSQL database. This will also create an adminstrator account, the default username and password are `admin`.

Also edit the `/inc/config.inc.php` file with the correct database information and adjust any other settings to your requirements. The setup should now be complete.
